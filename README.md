# godot-kotlin

## Introduction

**Disclaimer** - I probably do not have the technical expertise to actually make this work. If you happened upon this repo by searching or just browsing the org, don't expect much here :)

I have come across one (maybe two) others from Google searching who have posted about supporting Kotlin in Godot Engine. I'm probably wrong, but the little I have experimented and understand so far, the steps may be to use the cinterop to generate c bindings, and then perhaps a ton of work to expose Kotlin classes to interface with the interop functions.
